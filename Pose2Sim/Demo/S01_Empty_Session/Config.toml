# Configure your project parameters here. 
# 
# IMPORTANT:
# If a parameter is not found here, Pose2Sim will look for its value in the 
# Config.toml file of the level above. This way, you can set global 
# instructions for the Session and alter them for specific Participants or Trials.
#
# If you wish to overwrite a parameter for a specific trial or participant, 
# edit its Config.toml file by uncommenting its key (e.g., [project])
# and editing its value (e.g., frame_range = [10,300]). Or else, uncomment 
# [filtering.butterworth] and set cut_off_frequency = 10, etc.

## frame_range = [0.1, 2.0]*frame_rate = [6, 120]

## CUSTOM skeleton, if you trained your own DeepLabCut model for example. 
## Make sure the node ids correspond to the column numbers of the 2D pose file, starting from zero.
## 
## If you want to perform inverse kinematics, you will also need to create an OpenSim model
## and add to its markerset the location where you expect the triangulated keypoints to be detected.
## 
## In this example, CUSTOM reproduces the BODY_25B skeleton  (default skeletons are stored in skeletons.py).
## You can create as many custom skeletons as you want, just add them further down and rename them.
## 
## Check your model hierarchy with:  for pre, _, node in RenderTree(model): 
##                                      print(f'{pre}{node.name} id={node.id}')
