# Pose2Sim


##### N.B:. Please set undistort_points and handle_LR_swap to false for now since it currently leads to inaccuracies. I'll try to fix it soon.

> **_News_: Version 0.9:**\
> **Pose estimation with RTMPose is now included in Pose2Sim!**\
> **Other recently added features**: Automatic camera synchronization, multi-person analysis, Blender visualization, Marker augmentation, Automatic batch processing.
<!-- Incidentally, right/left limb swapping is now handled, which is useful if few cameras are used;\
and lens distortions are better taken into account.\ -->
> To upgrade, type `pip install pose2sim --upgrade`.

<br>

`Pose2Sim` provides a workflow for 3D markerless kinematics, as an alternative to the more usual marker-based motion capture methods. It aims to provide a free tool to obtain research-grade results from consumer-grade equipment. Any combination of phone, webcam, GoPro, etc. can be used.

Pose2Sim stands for "OpenPose to OpenSim", as it originally used OpenPose inputs (2D keypoints coordinates obtained from multiple videos) and lead to an [OpenSim](https://opensim.stanford.edu/) result (full-body 3D joint angles). Pose estimation is now performed with more recent models from [RTMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmpose), and OpenPose and other options are kept as legacy options. 

If you can only use one single camera and don't mind losing some accuracy, please consider using [Sports2D](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Sports2D).

# Installation and Demonstration

## Installation

1. ***Optional:***\
*Install Anaconda or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for simplicity and avoiding the risk of incompatibilities between libraries.*

   Once installed, open an Anaconda prompt and create a virtual environment:
   ```
   conda create -n Pose2Sim python=3.9 -y 
   conda activate Pose2Sim
   ```

2. **Install OpenSim**:\
Install the OpenSim Python API (if you do not want to install via conda, refer [to this page](https://opensimconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenSim/pages/53085346/Scripting+in+Python#ScriptinginPython-SettingupyourPythonscriptingenvironment(ifnotusingconda))):
   ```
   conda install -c opensim-org opensim -y
   ```
   
3. **INSTALL POSE2SIM**:\
If you don't use Anaconda, type `python -V` in terminal to make sure python>=3.9 is installed. 
   - OPTION 1: **Quick install:** Open a terminal. 
       ``` cmd
       pip install pose2sim
       ```
     
   - OPTION 2: **Build from source and test the last changes:**
     Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and Clone the Pose2Sim repository.
       ``` cmd
       git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim.git
       cd pose2sim
       pip install .
       ```

4. ***Optional:***\
   *Install pyTorch with CUDA and cuDNN support if you want faster inference by running on the GPU.*
   
   Go to the [pyTorch website]( https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally), select the latest CUDA version that is also [available with ONNX runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/CUDA-ExecutionProvider.html#requirements), and run the provided command.\
   For example, for Windows 11 (June 6th, 2024), CUDA 12.4 is not available for pyTorch, and CUDA 12.1 is not available for ONNX Runtime, so you should revert to CUDA 11.8:
   ```
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

  <!-- import torch; torch.cuda.is_available() -->
  
   N.B.: You may get an error related to the version of typing-extensions, but this will not have any influence on your results. Don't worry about a warning related to onnxruntime during pose estimation either.

</br>

## Demonstration Part-1: Build 3D TRC file
> _**This demonstration provides an example experiment of a person balancing on a beam, filmed with 4 cameras.**_ 

Open a terminal, enter `pip show pose2sim`, report package location. \
Copy this path and go to the Single participant Demo folder: `cd <path>\Pose2Sim\S01_Demo_SingleTrial`. \
Type `ipython`, and try the following code:
``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.calibration()
Pose2Sim.poseEstimation()
Pose2Sim.synchronization()
Pose2Sim.personAssociation()
Pose2Sim.triangulation()
Pose2Sim.filtering()
Pose2Sim.markerAugmentation()
```
3D results are stored as .trc files in each trial folder in the `pose-3d` directory.

*N.B.:* Default parameters have been provided in [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) but can be edited.

</br>

__*GO FURTHER:*__\
Try the calibration tool by changing `calibration_type` to `calculate` instead of `convert` in [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) (more info [there](#calculate-from-scratch)).

<br/>

## Demonstration Part-2: Obtain 3D joint angles with OpenSim  
> _**In the same vein as you would do with marker-based kinematics, start with scaling your model, and then perform inverse kinematics.**_ 

> N.B.: For now, you still need to install [OpenSim GUI](https://simtk.org/frs/index.php?group_id=91) (tested up to v4.5 on Windows, has to be compiled [from source on Linux](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Linux+Support)). Will be done natively within Pose2Sim soon.
   
<!--
   To visualize the animated skeletons, you can either install:
   - **[Pose2Sim_Blender](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Pose2Sim_Blender) (recommended, see [Demonstration Part 3](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Linux+Support))**, or 
      - [OpenSim GUI](https://simtk.org/frs/index.php?group_id=91) (tested up to v4.5 on Windows, has to be compiled [from source on Linux](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Linux+Support)).
-->  

### Scaling
1. Open OpenSim.
2. Open the provided `Model_Pose2Sim_LSTM.osim` model from `Pose2Sim/OpenSim_Setup`. *(File -> Open Model)*
3. Load the provided `Scaling_Setup_Pose2Sim_LSTM.xml` scaling file from `Pose2Sim/OpenSim_Setup`. *(Tools -> Scale model -> Load)*
4. Run. You should see your skeletal model take the static pose.
5. Save your scaled model in `S01_Demo_SingleTrial/OpenSim/Model_Pose2Sim_S00_P00_LSTM_scaled.osim`. *(File -> Save Model As)*

### Inverse kinematics
1. Load the provided `IK_Setup_Pose2Sim_LSTM.xml` scaling file from `Pose2Sim/OpenSim_Setup`. *(Tools -> Inverse kinematics -> Load)*
2. Run. You should see your skeletal model move in the Visualizer window.
5. Your IK motion file will be saved in `S00_P00_OpenSim`.
<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="Content/OpenSim.JPG" width="380"></p>

</br>

## Demonstration Part-3 (optional): Visualize your results with Blender
> _**Visualize your results and look in detail for potential areas of improvement (and more).**_ 

### Install the add-on
Follow instructions on the [Pose2Sim_Blender](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Pose2Sim_Blender) add-on page.

### Visualize your results
Just play with the buttons!\
Visualize camera positions, videos, triangulated keypoints, OpenSim skeleton, and more.

**N.B.:** You need to proceed to the full install to import the inverse kinematic results from OpenSim. See instructions [there](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Pose2Sim_Blender?tab=readme-ov-file#full-install).

https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/assets/54667644/5d7c858f-7e46-40c1-928c-571a5679633a

<br/>

## Demonstration Part-4 (optional): Try multi-person analysis
> _**Another person, hidden all along, will appear when multi-person analysis is activated!**_

Go to the Multi-participant Demo folder: `cd <path>\Pose2Sim\S00_Demo_BatchSession\S00_P01_MultiParticipants\S00_P01_T02_Participants1-2`. \
Type `ipython`, and try the following code:
``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.personAssociation()
Pose2Sim.triangulation()
Pose2Sim.filtering()
Pose2Sim.markerAugmentation()
```

One .trc file per participant will be generated and stored in the `pose-3d` directory.\
You can then run OpenSim scaling and inverse kinematics for each resulting .trc file as in [Demonstration Part-2](#demonstration-part-2-obtain-3d-joint-angles-with-opensim).\
You can also visualize your results with Blender as in [Demonstration Part-3](#demonstration-part-3-optional-visualize-your-results-with-blender).

*N.B.:* Set *[project]* `multi_person = true` for each trial that contains multiple persons.\
Set *[triangulation]* `reorder_trc = true` if you need to run OpenSim and to match the generated .trc files with the static trials.\
Make sure that the order of *[markerAugmentation]* `participant_height` and `participant_mass` matches the order of the static trials.

*N.B.:* Note that in the case of our floating ghost participant, marker augmentation may worsen the results. See [Marker augmentation](#marker-augmentation) for instruction on when and when not to use it.


</br></br>

# Use on your own data

> _**Deeper explanations and instructions are given below.**_ \
> N.B.: If a step is not relevant for your use case (synchronization, person association, marker augmentation...), you can skip it.

</br>

## Setting your project up
  > _**Get ready for automatic batch processing.**_
  
### Retrieve the folder structure
  1. Open a terminal, enter `pip show pose2sim`, report package location. \
     Copy this path and do `cd <path>\pose2sim`.
  2. Copy the *single trial* or *batch session* folder wherever you like, and rename it as you wish. 
  3. The rest of the tutorial will explain to you how to populate the `Calibration` and `videos` folders, edit the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) files, and run each Pose2Sim step.

</br>

### Single Trial vs. Batch processing

> _**Copy and edit either the [S01_Demo_SingleTrial](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial) folder or the [S00_Demo_BatchSession](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S00_Demo_BatchSession) one.**_ 
> - Single trial is more straight-forward to set up for isolated experiments
> - Batch processing allows you to run numerous analysis with different parameters and minimal friction



#### Single trial

The single trial folder should contain a `Config.toml` file, a `calibration` folder, and a `pose` folder, the latter including one subfolder for each camera.

<pre>
SingleTrial \
├── calibration \
├── pose \
└── <i><b>Config.toml</i></b>
</pre>

#### Batch processing

For batch processing, each session directory should follow a `Session -> Participant -> Trial` structure, with a `Config.toml` file in each of the directory levels. 

<pre>
Session_s1         \ <i><b>Config.toml</i></b>
├── Calibration\ 
└── Participant_p1 \ <i><b>Config.toml</i></b>
    └── Trial_t1   \ <i><b>Config.toml</i></b>
        └── pose \
</pre>

Run Pose2Sim from the `Session` folder if you want to batch process the whole session, from the `Participant` folder if you want to batch process all the trials of a participant, or from the `Trial` folder if you want to process a single trial. There should be one `Calibration` folder per session. 

Global parameters are given in the `Config.toml` file of the `Session` folder, and can be altered for specific `Participants` or `Trials` by uncommenting keys and their values in their respective Config.toml files.\
Try uncommenting `[project]` and set `frame_range = [10,300]` for a Participant for example, or uncomment `[filtering.butterworth]` and set `cut_off_frequency = 10` for a Trial.

</br>

## 2D pose estimation
> _**Estimate 2D pose from images with RTMPose or another pose estimation solution.**_ 

> N.B.: Note that the names of your camera folders must follow the same order as in the calibration file, and end with '_json'.

### With RTMPose *(default)*:
> [RTMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/main/projects/rtmpose) is a state-of-the-art pose estimation solution that is faster and more accurate than OpenPose. It is now included in Pose2Sim for straightforward end-to-end analysis.

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.

``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.poseEstimation()
```

*N.B.:* The GPU will be used with ONNX backend if a valid CUDA installation is used, otherwise the OpenVINO backend will be used.\
*N.B.:* Pose estimation can be run in Lightweight, Balanced, or Performance mode.\
*N.B.:* Detection can be done every frame, or at any chosen interval. Inbetween, previously detected keypoints are tracked.\
*N.B.:* The detection can also attempt to give consistent IDs to the same persons across frames.

</br>

### With MMPose *(coming soon)*:

> Coming soon

### With DeepLabCut:
> If you need to detect specific points on a human being, an animal, or an object, you can also train your own model with [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut). In this case, Pose2Sim is used as an alternative to [AniPose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/anipose).
1. Train your DeepLabCut model and run it on your images or videos (more instruction on their repository)
2. Translate the h5 2D coordinates to json files (with `DLC_to_OpenPose.py` script, see [Utilities](#utilities)): 
   ``` cmd
   python -m DLC_to_OpenPose -i input_h5_file
   ```
3. Edit `pose.CUSTOM` in [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml), and edit the node IDs so that they correspond to the column numbers of the 2D pose file, starting from zero. Make sure you also changed the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint`.\
   You can visualize your skeleton's hierarchy by changing pose_model to CUSTOM and writing these lines: 
   ``` python
    config_path = r'path_to_Config.toml'
    import toml, anytree
    config = toml.load(config_path)
    pose_model = config.get('pose').get('pose_model')
    model = anytree.importer.DictImporter().import_(config.get('pose').get(pose_model))
    for pre, _, node in anytree.RenderTree(model): 
        print(f'{pre}{node.name} id={node.id}')
   ```
4. Create an OpenSim model if you need inverse kinematics.

### With OpenPose *(legacy)*:
> **N.B.: RTMlib is faster, more accurate, and easier to install than OpenPose. This is a legacy option.**\
> N.B.: OpenPose model files are apparently not available on their website anymore. Send me an email at dp2032@bath.ac.uk if you want me to forward them to you!

The accuracy and robustness of Pose2Sim have been thoroughly assessed only with OpenPose, BODY_25B model. Consequently, we recommend using this 2D pose estimation solution. See [OpenPose repository](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) for installation and running. *Windows portable demo is enough.*

* Open a command prompt in your **OpenPose** directory. \
  Launch OpenPose for each `videos` folder: 
  ``` cmd
  bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --model_pose BODY_25B --video <PATH_TO_TRIAL_DIR>\videos\cam01.mp4 --write_json <PATH_TO_TRIAL_DIR>\pose\pose_cam01_json
  ```
* The [BODY_25B model](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train/tree/master/experimental_models) has more accurate results than the standard BODY_25 one and has been extensively tested for Pose2Sim. \
You can also use the [BODY_135 model](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train/tree/master/experimental_models), which allows for the evaluation of pronation/supination, wrist flexion, and wrist deviation.\
All other OpenPose models (BODY_25, COCO, MPII) are also supported.\
Make sure you modify the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) file accordingly.
* Use one of the `json_display_with_img.py` or `json_display_with_img.py` scripts (see [Utilities](#utilities)) if you want to display 2D pose detections.

### With MediaPipe BlazePose *(legacy)*:
> **N.B.: RTMlib is faster, more accurate, and easier to install than BlazePose. This is also a legacy option.**

[Mediapipe BlazePose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) is very fast, fully runs under Python, handles upside-down postures and wrist movements (but no subtalar ankle angles). \
However, it is less robust and accurate than OpenPose, and can only detect a single person.
* Use the script `Blazepose_runsave.py` (see [Utilities](#utilities)) to run BlazePose under Python, and store the detected coordinates in OpenPose (json) or DeepLabCut (h5 or csv) format: 
  ``` cmd
  python -m Blazepose_runsave -i input_file -dJs
  ```
  Type in `python -m Blazepose_runsave -h` for explanation on parameters.
* Make sure you changed the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint` in the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) file.

### With AlphaPose *(legacy)*:
> **N.B.: RTMlib is faster, more accurate, and easier to install than AlphaPose. This is also a legacy option.**

[AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) is one of the main competitors of OpenPose, and its accuracy is comparable. As a top-down approach (unlike OpenPose which is bottom-up), it is faster on single-person detection, but slower on multi-person detection.\
All AlphaPose models are supported (HALPE_26, HALPE_68, HALPE_136, COCO_133, COCO, MPII). For COCO and MPII, AlphaPose must be run with the flag "--format cmu".
* Install and run AlphaPose on your videos (more instruction on their repository)
* Translate the AlphaPose single json file to OpenPose frame-by-frame files (with `AlphaPose_to_OpenPose.py` script, see [Utilities](#utilities)): 
   ``` cmd
   python -m AlphaPose_to_OpenPose -i input_alphapose_json_file
   ```
* Make sure you changed the `pose_model` and the `tracked_keypoint` in the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) file.

## Camera calibration
> _**Calculate camera intrinsic properties and extrinsic locations and positions.\
> Convert a preexisting calibration file, or calculate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from scratch.**_

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.


``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.calibration()
```

Output:\
<img src="Content/Calib2D.png" width="760">
<img src="Content/CalibFile.png" width="760">


### Convert from Qualisys, Optitrack, Vicon, OpenCap, EasyMocap, or bioCV

If you already have a calibration file, set `calibration_type` type to `convert` in your [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Empty_project/User/Config.toml) file.
- **From [Qualisys](https://www.qualisys.com):**
  - Export calibration to `.qca.txt` within QTM.
  - Copy it in the `Calibration` Pose2Sim folder.
  - set `convert_from` to 'qualisys' in your [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) file. Change `binning_factor` to 2 if you film in 540p.
- **From [Optitrack](https://optitrack.com/):** Exporting calibration will be available in Motive 3.2. In the meantime:
  - Calculate intrinsics with a board (see next section).
  - Use their C++ API [to retrieve extrinsic properties](https://docs.optitrack.com/developer-tools/motive-api/motive-api-function-reference#tt_cameraxlocation). Translation can be copied as is in your `Calib.toml` file, but TT_CameraOrientationMatrix first needs to be [converted to a Rodrigues vector](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga61585db663d9da06b68e70cfbf6a1eac) with OpenCV. See instructions [here](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/28).
  - Use the `Calib.toml` file as is and do not run Pose2Sim.calibration()
- **From [Vicon](http://www.vicon.com/Software/Nexus):**  
  - Copy your `.xcp` Vicon calibration file to the Pose2Sim `Calibration` folder.
  - set `convert_from` to 'vicon' in your [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S01_Demo_SingleTrial/Config.toml) file. No other setting is needed.

### Calculate from scratch

> _**Calculate calibration parameters with a checkerboard, with measurements on the scene, or automatically with detected keypoints.**_\
> Take heart, it is not that complicated once you get the hang of it!

  > *N.B.:* Try the calibration tool on the Demo by changing `calibration_type` to `calculate` in [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S00_Demo_BatchSession/Config.toml).\
  For the sake of practicality, there are voluntarily few board images for intrinsic calibration, and few points to click for extrinsic calibration. In spite of this, your reprojection error should be under 1-2 cm, which [does not hinder the quality of kinematic results in practice](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/19/6530/htm#:~:text=Angle%20results%20were,Table%203).).
  
  - **Calculate intrinsic parameters with a checkerboard:**

    > *N.B.:* _Intrinsic parameters:_ camera properties (focal length, optical center, distortion), usually need to be calculated only once in their lifetime. In theory, cameras with same model and same settings will have identical intrinsic parameters.\
    > *N.B.:* If you already calculated intrinsic parameters earlier, you can skip this step by setting `overwrite_intrinsics` to false.

    - Create a folder for each camera in your `Calibration\intrinsics` folder.
    - For each camera, film a checkerboard or a charucoboard. Either the board or the camera can be moved.
    - Adjust parameters in the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S00_Demo_BatchSession/Config.toml) file.
    - Make sure that the board:
      - is filmed from different angles, covers a large part of the video frame, and is in focus.
      - is flat, without reflections, surrounded by a wide white border, and is not rotationally invariant (Nrows ≠ Ncols, and Nrows odd if Ncols even). Go to [calib.io](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator) to generate a suitable checkerboard.
    - A common error is to specify the external, instead of the internal number of corners (one less than the count from calib.io). This may be one less than you would intuitively think. 
    
    <img src="Content/Calib_int.png" width="600">

    ***Intrinsic calibration error should be below 0.5 px.***
        
- **Calculate extrinsic parameters:** 

  > *N.B.:* _Extrinsic parameters:_ camera placement in space (position and orientation), need to be calculated every time a camera is moved. Can be calculated from a board, or from points in the scene with known coordinates.\
  > *N.B.:* If there is no measurable item in the scene, you can temporarily bring something in (a table, for example), perform calibration, and then remove it before you start capturing motion.

  - Create a folder for each camera in your `Calibration\extrinsics` folder.
  - Once your cameras are in place, shortly film either a board laid on the floor, or the raw scene\
  (only one frame is needed, but do not just take a photo unless you are sure it does not change the image format).
  - Adjust parameters in the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S00_Demo_BatchSession/Config.toml) file.
  - Then,
    - **With a checkerboard:**\
      Make sure that it is seen by all cameras. \
      It should preferably be larger than the one used for intrinsics, as results will not be very accurate out of the covered zone.
    - **With scene measurements** (more flexible and potentially more accurate if points are spread out):\
      Manually measure the 3D coordinates of 10 or more points in the scene (tiles, lines on wall, boxes, treadmill dimensions...). These points should be as spread out as possible. Replace `object_coords_3d` by these coordinates in Config.toml.\
      Then you will click on the corresponding image points for each view.
    - **With keypoints:**\
      For a more automatic calibration, OpenPose keypoints could also be used for calibration.\
      **COMING SOON!**

  <img src="Content/Calib_ext.png" width="920">
  
  ***Extrinsic calibration error should be below 1 cm, but depending on your application, results will still be potentially acceptable up to 2.5 cm.***

</br>


## Synchronizing, Tracking, Triangulating, Filtering

### Synchronization

> _**Cameras need to be synchronized, so that 2D points correspond to the same position across cameras.**_\
***N.B.:** Skip this step if your cameras are natively synchronized.*

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.

``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.synchronization()
```

For each camera, this computes mean vertical speed for the chosen keypoints, and finds the time offset for which their correlation is highest.\
All keypoints can be taken into account, or a subset of them. The user can also specify a time for each camera when only one participant is in the scene, preferably performing a clear vertical motion. 

*N.B.:* Works best when only one participant is in the scene, at a roughly equal distance from all cameras and when the capture is at least 5-10 seconds long.

*N.B.:* Alternatively, use a flashlight, a clap, or a clear event to synchronize cameras. GoPro cameras can also be synchronized with a timecode, by GPS (outdoors) or with their app (slightly less reliable).


</br>

### Associate persons across cameras

> _**If `multi_person` is set to `false`, the algorithm chooses the person for whom the reprojection error is smallest.\
  If `multi_person` is set to `true`, it associates across views the people for whom the distances between epipolar lines are the smallest. People are then associated across frames according to their displacement speed.**_ \
***N.B.:** Skip this step if only one person is in the field of view.*

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.
``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.personAssociation()
```

Check printed output. If results are not satisfying, try and release the constraints in the [Config.toml](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/S00_Demo_Session/Config.toml) file.

Output:\
<img src="Content/Track2D.png" width="760">
   
</br>

### Triangulating keypoints
> _**Triangulate your 2D coordinates in a robust way.**_ \
> The triangulation is weighted by the likelihood of each detected 2D keypoint, provided that they this likelihood is above a threshold.\
  If the reprojection error is above another threshold, right and left sides are swapped; if it is still above, cameras are removed until the threshold is met. If more cameras are removed than a predefined number, triangulation is skipped for this point and this frame. In the end, missing values are interpolated.

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.

``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.triangulation()
```

Check printed output, and visualize your trc in OpenSim: `File -> Preview experimental data`.\
If your triangulation is not satisfying, try and release the constraints in the `Config.toml` file.

Output:\
<img src="Content/Triangulate3D.png" width="760">

</br>

### Filtering 3D coordinates
> _**Filter your 3D coordinates.**_\
> Numerous filter types are provided, and can be tuned accordingly.

Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.

``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.filtering()
```

Check your filtration with the displayed figures, and visualize your .trc file in OpenSim. If your filtering is not satisfying, try and change the parameters in the `Config.toml` file.

Output:\
<img src="Content/FilterPlot.png" width="760">

<img src="Content/Filter3D.png" width="760">

</br>

### Marker Augmentation
> _**Use the Stanford LSTM model to estimate the position of 47 virtual markers.**_\
_**Note that inverse kinematic results are not necessarily better after marker augmentation.**_ Skip if results are not convincing.

*N.B.:* Marker augmentation tends to give a more stable, but less precise output. In practice, it is mostly beneficial when using less than 4 cameras. 

**Make sure that `participant_height` is correct in your `Config.toml` file.** `participant_mass` is mostly optional for IK.\
Only works with models estimating at least the following keypoints (e.g., not COCO):
``` python
 ["Neck", "RShoulder", "LShoulder", "RHip", "LHip", "RKnee", "LKnee",
 "RAnkle", "LAnkle", "RHeel", "LHeel", "RSmallToe", "LSmallToe",
 "RBigToe", "LBigToe", "RElbow", "LElbow", "RWrist", "LWrist"]
```
Will not work properly if missing values are not interpolated (i.e., if there are Nan value in the .trc file).


Open an Anaconda prompt or a terminal in a `Session`, `Participant`, or `Trial` folder.\
Type `ipython`.

``` python
from Pose2Sim import Pose2Sim
Pose2Sim.markerAugmentation()
```

</br>

## OpenSim kinematics
> _**Obtain 3D joint angles.**_\
> Your OpenSim .osim scaled model and .mot inverse kinematic results will be found in the OpenSim folder of your `Participant` directory.

### OpenSim Scaling
1. Choose a time range where the 3D keypoints are particularly well reconstructed, or capture a static pose, typically an A-pose...
2. Open OpenSim.
3. Open the provided `Model_Pose2Sim_LSTM.osim` model from `Pose2Sim/OpenSim_Setup`. *(File -> Open Model)*
4. Load the provided `Scaling_Setup_Pose2Sim_LSTM.xml` scaling file. *(Tools -> Scale model -> Load)*
5. Replace the example .trc file with your own data.
6. Run
7. Save the new scaled OpenSim model.

### OpenSim Inverse kinematics
1. Load the provided `IK_Setup_Pose2Sim_LSTM.xml` scaling file from `Pose2Sim/OpenSim_Setup`. *(Tools -> Inverse kinematics -> Load)*
2. Replace the example .trc file with your own data, and specify the path to your angle kinematics output file.
3. Run.

</br>

### Command line
Alternatively, you can use command-line tools:

  <!-- - Take advantage of the full the OpenSim Python API. Run `ipython`:

  See [there](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+in+Python) for installation instructions (conda install may take a while).
  Make sure to replace `py38np120` with your Python version (3.8 in this case) and with your numpy version (1.20 here).
  ``` cmd
  conda install -c opensim-org opensim-moco=4.4=py38np120 -y
  ```
  If you run into a DLL error while importing opensim, open the file `<Pose2Sim-env>\Lib\opensim\__init__.py` and replace `conda`by `conda-meta` line 4. `<Pose2Sim-env>` location can be found with `conda env list`.\ -->
  
  ``` python
  import opensim
  opensim.ScaleTool("<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml").run()
  opensim.InverseKinematicsTool("<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml").run()
  ```
  
  N.B.: You'll need to adjust the `time_range`, `output_motion_file`, and enter the absolute path (NOT the relative path) to the input and output `.osim`, `.trc`, and `.mot` files in your setup file.
  
  You can also run other API commands. See [there](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Common+Scripting+Commands#CommonScriptingCommands-UsingtheTools) for more instructions on how to use it.

<!--
- Open an Anaconda terminal in your OpenSim/bin directory, typically `C:\OpenSim <Version>\bin`.\
  ``` cmd
  opensim-cmd run-tool <PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml
  ```

- You can also run OpenSim directly in Python:
  ``` python
  import subprocess
  subprocess.call(["opensim-cmd", "run-tool", r"<PATH TO YOUR SCALING OR IK SETUP FILE>.xml"])
  ```
-->

&#10004; **Triangulation:** Set a likelihood threshold below which a camera should not be used, a reprojection error threshold, and a minimum number of remaining cameras below which triangulation is skipped for this frame. 
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Interpolate missing frames (cubic, bezier, linear, slinear, quadratic)
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Show mean reprojection error in px and in mm for each keypoint.
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Show how many cameras on average had to be excluded for each keypoint.
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Evaluate which cameras were the least reliable.
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Show which frames had to be interpolated for each keypoint.
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Solve limb swapping (although not really an issue with Body_25b). Try triangulating with opposite side if reprojection error too large. Alternatively, ignore right and left sides, use RANSAC or SDS triangulation, and then choose right or left by majority voting. More confidence can be given to cameras whose plane is the most coplanar to the right/left line.
&#10004; **Triangulation:** [Undistort](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html#ga887960ea1bde84784e7f1710a922b93c) 2D points before triangulating (and [distort](https://github.com/lambdaloop/aniposelib/blob/d03b485c4e178d7cff076e9fe1ac36837db49158/aniposelib/cameras.py#L301) them before computing reprojection error).
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Offer the possibility to augment the triangulated data with [the OpenCap LSTM](https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/opencap-core/blob/main/utilsAugmenter.py). Create "BODY_25_AUGMENTED" model, Scaling_setup, IK_Setup. 
&#10004; **Triangulation:** Multiple person kinematics (output multiple .trc coordinates files). Triangulate all persons with reprojection error above threshold, and identify them by minimizing their displacement across frames.
&#9634; **Triangulation:** Pre-compile weighted_triangulation and reprojection with @jit(nopython=True, parallel=True) for faster execution.
&#9634; **Triangulation:** Offer the possibility of triangulating with Sparse Bundle Adjustment (SBA), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Full Trajectory Estimation (FTE) (see [AcinoSet](https://github.com/African-Robotics-Unit/AcinoSet)).
&#9634; **Triangulation:** Implement normalized DLT and RANSAC triangulation, Outlier rejection (sliding z-score?), as well as a [triangulation refinement step](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2022.3171102).
&#9634; **Triangulation:** Track hands and face (won't be taken into account in OpenSim at this stage).

&#10004; **Filtering:** Available filtering methods: Butterworth, Butterworth on speed, Gaussian, Median, LOESS (polynomial smoothing).
&#10004; **Filtering:** Implement Kalman filter and Kalman smoother.
&#9634; **Filtering:** Implement [smoothNet](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/29)

&#10004; **OpenSim:** Integrate better spine from [lifting fullbody model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30714401) to the [gait full-body model](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/07505900.pdf), more accurate for the knee.
&#10004; **OpenSim:** Optimize model marker positions as compared to ground-truth marker-based positions.
&#10004; **OpenSim:** Add scaling and inverse kinematics setup files.
&#10004; **OpenSim:** Add full model with contact spheres ([SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/classOpenSim_1_1SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce.html#details)) and full-body muscles ([DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/classOpenSim_1_1DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle.html#details)), for [Moco](https://opensim-org.github.io/opensim-moco-site/) for example.
&#10004; **OpenSim:** Add model with [ISB shoulder](https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/opencap-core/blob/main/opensimPipeline/Models/LaiUhlrich2022_shoulder.osim).
&#9634; **OpenSim:** Integrate OpenSim in Pose2Sim.
&#9634; **OpenSim:** Do not require a separate scaling trial: scale on the 10 slowest frames of the moving trial instead.
&#9634; **OpenSim:** Implement optimal fixed-interval Kalman smoothing for inverse kinematics ([this OpenSim fork](https://github.com/antoinefalisse/opensim-core/blob/kalman_smoother/OpenSim/Tools/InverseKinematicsKSTool.cpp)), or [Biorbd](https://github.com/pyomeca/biorbd/blob/f776fe02e1472aebe94a5c89f0309360b52e2cbc/src/RigidBody/KalmanReconsMarkers.cpp))

&#10004; **GUI:** Blender add-on (cf [MPP2SOS](https://blendermarket.com/products/mocap-mpp2soss)), [Maya-Mocap](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Maya-Mocap) and [BlendOsim](https://github.com/JonathanCamargo/BlendOsim).
&#9634; **GUI:** App or webapp (e.g., with [Napari](https://napari.org/stable).
&#9634; **GUI:** 3D plot of cameras and of triangulated keypoints.
&#9634; **GUI:** Demo on Google Colab (see [Sports2D](https://bit.ly/Sports2D_Colab) for OpenPose and Python package installation on Google Drive).

&#10004; **Demo:** Add videos for users to experiment with other pose detection frameworks
&#10004; **Demo:** Time shift videos and json to demonstrate synchronization
&#10004; **Demo:** Add another virtual person to demonstrate personAssociation
&#9634; **Tutorials:** Make video tutorials.
&#9634; **Doc:** Use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), or (maybe better), [github.io](https://docs.github.com/fr/pages/quickstart) for clearer documentation.

&#9634; **Run from command line via click or typer**
&#9634; **Utilities**: Export other data from c3d files into .mot or .sto files (angles, powers, forces, moments, GRF, EMG...)
&#9634; **Utilities**: Create trc_to_c3d.py script

&#10004; **Bug:** calibration.py. FFMPEG error message when calibration files are images. See [there](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/issues/33#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20check,filter%20this%20message%20yet.).
&#9634; **Bug:** common.py, class plotWindow(). Python crashes after a few runs of `Pose2Sim.filtering()` when `display_figures=true`. See [there](https://github.com/superjax/plotWindow/issues/7).
