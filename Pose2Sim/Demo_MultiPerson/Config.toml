# Configure your project parameters here. 
# 
# IMPORTANT:
# If a parameter is not found here, Pose2Sim will look for its value in the 
# Config.toml file of the level above. This way, you can set global 
# instructions for the Session and alter them for specific Participants or Trials.
#
# If you wish to overwrite a parameter for a specific trial or participant,  
# edit its Config.toml file by uncommenting its key (e.g., [project])
# and editing its value (e.g., frame_range = [10,300]). Or else, uncomment 
# [filtering.butterworth] and set cut_off_frequency = 10, etc.

## If cameras are not synchronized, designates the frame range of the camera with the shortest recording time
## N.B.: If you want a time range instead, use frame_range = time_range * frame_rate
